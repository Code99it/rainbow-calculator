The **Rainbow Calculator** is a web-based calculator that allows users 
to perform basic arithmetic operations. It also supports indicator 
displays for features like `DEG` (degrees) or `M` (memory) and logs 
keypress inputs in a development box.

Key features:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Angle unit display (`DEG` or `RAD`)
- Memory functionality (`M+`, `MR`)
- Development box for tracking key inputs
- Color-coded buttons for better UI experience

The project is actively maintained and new features are added 
regularly.
